OSINT Template Engine is a research-grade tool for OSINT Information gathering & Attack Surface Mapping which uses customizable templates to collect data from sources. It allows for new template creation and modification of existing ones which gives it a competitive advantage over other tools of the same category. For more information see the [documentation](https://github.com/3nock/OTE/wiki).

There are thousands of sources that provide OSINT information about various targets through their API Endpoints. OSINT Template Engine combines these capabilities into a template(a single template for a single OSINT source) giving you access to their entire available API enpoints.

Different from other already available tools, OSINT Template Engine allows you to easily modify the API endpoints interactions by customizing the endpoint's links and parameters which helps in preventing dead links incases of API endpoint updates and upgrades by the OSINT sources.

See the dedicated [respository](https://github.com/3nock/OTE-Templates) which contains all the templates available for the OSINT Template Engine.
