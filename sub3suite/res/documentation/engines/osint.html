<h2> What is? </h2>
The Osint engine is used for obtaining different types of osint data from different input types.<br>
The tool uses different osint modules to obtain the desired data.<br>

Each Module gets its own thread for querying the same targets. for multiple targets the thread queries on target after
another due to query request's rate limits impossed by most modules.

<h2> Modules </h2>
The osint engine uses different osint source to obtain its results.
The osint modules are mainly categorized in two major groups; Those that require API keys & those that do not require API keys.
They are further categorized into different sub-groups depending on the type that the osint source majorly deals with.<br>

<h3> The Osint Source's Sub-groups </h3><br>
<b>--> Certificates sub-group:</b>  These Osint Sources majorly contains resources associating with SSL Certificates gathered for different sites.<br>
<b>--> Emails sub-group:</b> These Osint Sources majorly deals with osint of emails.<br>
<b>--> API sub-group:</b> These are Osint Sources that contain a variety of osint API endpoints.<br>
<b>--> Archives sub-group:</b> These are Osint Sources containing archives of different internet entities.<br>
<b>--> Scrape sub-group:</b> These are Osint modules that obtain data by scrapping the indicated search engine.<br>
<b>--> Site sub-group:</b> These are Osint modules that obtain data from different website containing osint info.<br>

<h2> Scan Configuration values: </h2><br>
<b> Timeout - </b> Time for performing the lookup in milliseconds (terminates connection if timeout). It is advised for the timeout to be greater than 1000<br>
<b> No Duplicates - </b> Check to avoid duplicated results of the target<br>
<b> AutoSave To Project - </b> Sends the obtained results directly to the project explorer as the scan progresses<br>

<h2> Actions: </h2>

Details on the actions for the obtained results.<br>

 - The Actions on Results are accessible via the <b>Actions ></b> button and <b>Right-Click</b> on the Results. & are only active when the results are present<br>

1. <b> Clear: </b> Clears the results and the progress bar.<br>
2. <b> Expand & Collapse: </b> Expands the all areas of the result tree and Collapse all areas of the result tree respectively<br>
3. <b> Save: </b> Saves the obtained Results To a File. Saves in Json format<br>
4. <b> Copy: </b> Copies the results on the clipboard. Copies in Json format<br>
5. <b> Send To Project: </b> Sends the Obtained results to the project explorer.<br>
5. <b> Send * To *: </b> Sends the Result Type to the choosen Engine/Enumerator.<br><br>

<b> NOTE: </b><br>
	If you have filtered the results using the filter. the above actions will only be performed on the remaing results after filter<br>
