<h1> RAW ENGINE </h1>

<h2> What is? </h2>
The Raw Engine queries API endpoints of different osint modules to return raw json results.<br>
The tool uses different osint modules and their different endpoints to obtain the desired output.<br><br>

This Tool does not support multi-threading, uses one thread upon each invocation to perform one lookup after another
even for multiple targets due to rate limits imposed by most osint sources(modules).<br>

<h2> Modules </h2>
The osint modules are mainly categorized in two major groups; Those that require API keys & those that do not require API keys.
They are further categorized into different sub-groups depending on the type that the osint source majorly deals with.<br>

<h3> The Osint Source's Sub-groups </h3><br>
<b>--> Iana sub-group:</b> These are the Osint Sources associated with the Iana.<br>
<b>--> Certificates sub-group:</b>  These Osint Sources majorly contains resources associating with SSL Certificates gathered for different sites.<br>
<b>--> Emails sub-group:</b> These Osint Sources majorly deals with osint of emails.<br>
<b>--> API sub-group:</b> These are Osint Sources that contain a variety of osint API endpoints.<br>
<b>--> Archives sub-group:</b> These are Osint Sources containing archives of different internet entities.<br>
<b>--> Scrape sub-group:</b> These are Osint modules that obtain data by scrapping the indicated search engine.<br>
<b>--> Site sub-group:</b> These are Osint modules that obtain data from different website containing osint info.<br>

<h2> Features </h2>
1. Supports different Input types depending on the endpoint query request<br>
2. Results are returned as Raw json in a TextEdit and also as item-based in a TreeView.<br>
3. Use filters to extract specific entities from the returned json results<br>
2. Supports querying for multiple targets.<br>
