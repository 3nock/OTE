Records Supported by DNS Engine:<br>
--> <b> A Records</b>: ipv4 address.<br>
--> <b> AAAA Records </b>: ipv6 address.<br>
--> <b> NS Records </b>: Nameservers records.<br>
--> <b> MX Records </b>: Mail Exchange records.<br>
--> <b> CNAME Records </b>: Canonical records.<br>
--> <b> TXT Records </b>: TXT Records.<br>
--> <b> SRV Records </b>: Service Records.<br><br>
