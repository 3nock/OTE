<h2> What is? </h2>
The Active Engine performs enumeration on target hostnames to determine active ones.<br><br>

The Tool performs this enumeration using multiple techniques;<br>
	--> DNS Lookup by resolving target to A(ipv4) or AAAA(ipv6) dns records as configured by user.<br>
	--> Pinging the Target to see if its active.<br>
	--> Trying to connect to target using different services e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH etc. Rr any as specified by user.<br><br>
	
This Tool uses multiple threads as alocated by the user to perform enumeration on targets also support use of multiple nameservers as provided
by the user or default list by s3s.<br><br>

You can obtain Passive Domains/Hostnames from the <a href=../engines/osint.html>OSINT Engine</a> of Sub3 Suite

<h2> Features </h2>
1. Supports use of multiple nameservers.<br>
2. Supports A(ipv4) and AAAA(ipv6) dns records lookups.<br>
5. Supports multiple Targets lookup in one scan (one target after another).<br>
5. Supports enumeration by connecting to host on specified ports eg (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP etc.).
6. Supports enumeration by Pinging The targets.

<h2> Input Output: </h2><br>
<b> Input: </b> Domain/Hostname<br>
<b> Output: </b> Resolved Domain, IPv4,IPv6 & open Ports<br>

<h2> Scan Configuration values: </h2><br>
<b> Threads - </b> Number of threads to use for quering the targets. If number of threads is greater that the number of targets, then one thread per target will be used.
<b> Timeout - </b> Time for performing the lookup in milliseconds (terminates connection if timeout). It is advised for the timeout to be greater than 1000<br>
<b> Record Type - </b> Record Type to lookup, A -> IpV4, AAAA -> IpV6, ANY -> IpV4 and/or IpV6.<br>
<b> Nameserver - </b> - Nameservers to use for DNS lookup.<br>
<b> No Duplicates - </b> Check to avoid duplicated results of the target<br>
<b> AutoSave To Project - </b> Sends the obtained results directly to the project explorer as the scan progresses<br>

<h2> Actions: </h2>

Details on the actions for the obtained results.<br>

 - The Actions on Results are accessible via the <b>Actions ></b> button and <b>Right-Click</b> on the Results. & are only active when the results are present<br>

1. <b> Clear: </b> Clears the results and the progress bar.<br>
2. <b> Expand & Collapse: </b> Expands the all areas of the result tree and Collapse all areas of the result tree respectively<br>
3. <b> Save: </b> Saves the obtained Results To a File. Saves in Json format<br>
4. <b> Copy: </b> Copies the results on the clipboard. Copies in Json format<br>
5. <b> Send To Project: </b> Sends the Obtained results to the project explorer.<br>
5. <b> Send * To *: </b> Sends the Result Type to the choosen Engine/Enumerator.<br><br>

<b> NOTE: </b><br>
	If you have filtered the results using the filter. the above actions will only be performed on the remaing results after filter<br>
