<h2> What is? </h2><br>

<b> NameServer(NS) - </b> A name server translates domain names into IP addresses. This makes it possible for a user to access a website by typing in the domain name instead of the website's actual IP address. For example, when you type in "www.microsoft.com," the request gets sent to Microsoft's name server which returns the IP address of the Microsoft website. 
Each domain name must have at least two name servers listed when the domain is registered. These name servers are commonly named ns1.servername.com and ns2.servername.com, where "servername" is the name of the server. The first server listed is the primary server, while the second is used as a backup server if the first server is not responding.

You can obtain NameServer of a domain using the <a href=../engines/dns.html>DNS Engine</a> of Sub3 Suite<br><br>

<b> NS Enumerator - </b> Is Used to return list  of domains that share the same primary name server. <br>
