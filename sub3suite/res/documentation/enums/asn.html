<h2> What is? </h2><br>

<b> ASN - </b> An autonomous system number(ASN) is a unique identifier that is globally available and allows its autonomous system to exchange routing information with other systems.
An autonomous system (AS) is a group of IP prefixes with a clearly defined external routing policy. In order for multiple autonomous systems to interact, each needs to have a unique identifier. 
Autonomous system numbers can be public or private. Public ASNs are required for systems to exchange information over the Internet. 
A private ASN can be used instead if a system is communicating solely with a single provider via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
<a href=https://blog.stackpath.com/autonomous-system-number> reference </a>.<br><br>

You can obtain ASN from the <a href=../engines/osint.html>OSINT Engine</a> and <a href=cidr.html>CIDR Enumerator</a> of Sub3 Suite<br><br>

<b> ASN Enumerator - </b> Is Used to return list useful information about the ASN. <br>
sub3suite's ASN Enumerator queries this data from OSINT sources that provide ASN Info lookup.<br>

<h2> Input Output </h2><br>

<b> Input: </b> ASN<br>
<b> Output: </b> ASN Info: owner's address, email contacts, abuser contacts, RIR info and related ASNs & CIDR<br>

<h2> Features: </h2><br>

<b> Multiple Targets search: </b> Search mulitple targets and the enumerator will provide the results for every targets.


<h2> Scan Configuration values: </h2><br>

<b> Timeout - </b> Time for performing the lookup in milliseconds (terminates connection if timeout). It is advised for the timeout to be greater than 1000<br>
<b> No Duplicates - </b> Check to avoid duplicated results of the target<br>
<b> AutoSave To Project - </b> Sends the obtained results directly to the project explorer as the scan progresses<br>


<h2> Usage: </h2>

1. Set the scan configuration by clicking the <b>config</b> button, setting the values and save.<br>
2. <b>If single Target:</b> enter target (asn) on the LineEdit. <b>If multiple Targets:</b> check the <b>Multile Targes</b> checkbox and enter the target values (asn) on the ListView marked by <b> Targets </b>. <br>
3. Start The scan<br>

<h2> Actions: </h2>

Details on the actions for the obtained results.<br>

 - The Actions on Results are accessible via the <b>Actions ></b> button and <b>Right-Click</b> on the Results. & are only active when the results are present<br>

1. <b> Clear: </b> Clears the results and the progress bar.<br>
2. <b> Expand & Collapse: </b> Expands the all areas of the result tree and Collapse all areas of the result tree respectively<br>
3. <b> Save: </b> Saves the obtained Results To a File. Saves in Json format<br>
4. <b> Copy: </b> Copies the results on the clipboard. Copies in Json format<br>
5. <b> Send To Project: </b> Sends the Obtained results to the project explorer.<br>
5. <b> Send * To ENGINE*/ENUM*: </b> Sends the Obtained ASN,CIDR,Emails to the choosen Engine/Enumerator.<br><br>

<b> NOTE: </b><br>
	If you have filtered the results using the filter. the above actions will only be performed on the remaing results after filter<br>
