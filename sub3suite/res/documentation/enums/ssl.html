<h2> What is? </h2><br>

<b> SSL/TLS - </b> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. 
Although the SSL protocol was deprecated with the release of TLS 1.0 in 1999, it is still common to refer to these related technologies as "SSL" or "SSL/TLS". 
<a href=https://www.ssl.com/faqs/faq-what-is-ssl> reference </a>.<br><br>

<b> SSL Certificates - </b> SSL certificates make SSL/TLS encryption possible, and they contain the website's public key and the website's identity, along with related information. 
Devices attempting to communicate with the origin server will reference this file to obtain the public key and verify the server's identity. The private key is kept secret and secure.
<a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate> reference </a>.<br><br>

<b> SSL Enumerator - </b> Is used to enumerate SSL Certificates from targets by passively querying Certificate's hash (sha1 or sha256) to OSINT sources that has SSL Certificates resources such as <a href=https://crt.sh/> crt.sh </a> and pulling the obtained SSL Certificate to
obtain all relevant information stored in the certificate that can be useful to map the target.<br>
SSL Certificates store important information such as:<br>
1. Associated domains.<br>
2. Organization name & contacts.<br>
3. Issued & Expirely date of the certificate. etc<br><br>

sub3suite's SSL Enumerator pulls all the data from the SSL Certificate and present it in a very intuitive manner.

You can obtain SSL from the <a href=../engines/osint.html>OSINT Engine</a> and <a href=../engines/ssl.html>SSL Engine</a> of Sub3 Suite<br><br>

<h2> Input Output </h2><br>

<b> Input: </b> SSL Certificate Hash<br>
<b> Output: </b> The SSL Certificate<br>

<h2> Features: </h2><br>

<b> Multiple Targets search: </b> Search mulitple targets and the enumerator will provide the results for every targets.


<h2> Scan Configuration values: </h2><br>

<b> Timeout - </b> Time for performing the lookup in milliseconds (terminates connection if timeout). It is advised for the timeout to be greater than 1000<br>
<b> No Duplicates - </b> Check to avoid duplicated results of the target<br>
<b> AutoSave To Project - </b> Sends the obtained results directly to the project explorer as the scan progresses<br>


<h2> Usage: </h2>

1. Set the scan configuration by clicking the <b>config</b> button, setting the values and save.<br>
2. <b>If single Target:</b> enter target (ssl certificate hash) on the LineEdit. <b>If multiple Targets:</b> check the <b>Multile Targes</b> checkbox and enter the target values (ssl certificate hash) on the ListView marked by <b> Targets </b>. <br>
3. Start The scan<br>

<h2> Actions: </h2>

Details on the actions for the obtained results.<br>

 - The Actions on Results are accessible via the <b>Actions ></b> button and <b>Right-Click</b> on the Results. & are only active when the results are present<br>

1. <b> Clear: </b> Clears the results and the progress bar.<br>
2. <b> Expand & Collapse: </b> Expands the all areas of the result tree and Collapse all areas of the result tree respectively<br>
3. <b> Save: </b> Saves the obtained Results To a File. Saves in Json format<br>
4. <b> Copy: </b> Copies the results on the clipboard. Copies in Json format<br>
5. <b> Send To Project: </b> Sends the Obtained results to the project explorer.<br><br>

<b> NOTE: </b><br>
	If you have filtered the results using the filter. the above actions will only be performed on the remaing results after filter<br>
