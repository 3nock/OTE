<h2> What is? </h2>
<p style="color:white">
	<b> SSL/TLS - </b> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. 
	Although the SSL protocol was deprecated with the release of TLS 1.0 in 1999, it is still common to refer to these related technologies as "SSL" or "SSL/TLS". 
	<a href=https://www.ssl.com/faqs/faq-what-is-ssl> reference </a>.<br><br>

	<b> SSL Certificates - </b> SSL certificates make SSL/TLS encryption possible, and they contain the website's public key and the website's identity, along with related information. 
	Devices attempting to communicate with the origin server will reference this file to obtain the public key and verify the server's identity. The private key is kept secret and secure.

	<b> SSL Enumerator - </b> Is used to enumerate SSL Certificates from targets by passively querying Certificate's hash (sha1 or sha256) to OSINT sources that has SSL Certificates resources such as <a href=https://crt.sh/> crt.sh </a> and pulling the obtained SSL Certificate to
	obtain all relevant information stored in the certificate that can be useful to map the target.<br>
	SSL Certificates store important information such as:<br>
	1. Associated domains.<br>
	2. Organization name & contacts.<br>
	3. Issued & Expirely date of the certificate. etc<br><br>

	sub3suite's SSL Enumerator pulls all the data from the SSL Certificate and present it in a very intuitive manner.
