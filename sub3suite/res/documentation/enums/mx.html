<h2> What is? </h2><br>

<b> MailServer(MX) - </b> A mail server (or email server) is a computer system that sends and receives email. In many cases, web servers and mail servers are combined in a single machine. However, large ISPs and public email services (such as Gmail and Hotmail) may use dedicated hardware for sending and receiving email.
In order for a computer system to function as a mail server, it must include mail server software. This software allows the system administrator to create and manage email accounts for any domains hosted on the server. 
For example, if the server hosts the domain name "techterms.com," it can provide email accounts ending in "@techterms.com.".
